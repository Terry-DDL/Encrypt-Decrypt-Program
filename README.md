#Simple Substitution Cipher Tool
Small console program that lets you encrypt and decrypt secret messages using a fixed substitution cipher (A–Z + space). It also preserves the original letter casing by storing a parallel casing pattern.

---

##Features
Encrypt plaintext (letters + spaces) to symbols using a fixed mapping.
Decrypt from symbols back to text.
Preserves original uppercase / lowercase via a separate casing string.
Save / load encrypted data and casing pattern from text files.

---

##How to run:

E – Encrypt a message you type.
Saves:
encryptedMessage.txt – encrypted text
casingInfo.txt – casing pattern (U for uppercase, l for lowercase, space for other)

D – Decrypt. Choose R to read from the saved files, or M to type an encrypted string and casing pattern manually.

Q – Quit.
